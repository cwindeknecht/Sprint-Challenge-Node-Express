## Questions
1. What is Node?
..* Node is a client-side scripting environment.
2. What is Express?
..* (Had to look this up... may be vague/incorrect) Express is a framework used with Node to allow MVC design.  Though we used it prior to Thursday in a non-MVC fashion so I'm not sure about this...
3. What is Middleware?
..* Code that runs between the server and the client to provide actions that otherwise couldn't be done... I believe.
4. What is an endpoint?
..* I believe this is the route at the end of an http address after the route(or I suppose including the root).  So, if you are using http:www.google.com, it would be /, or in our projects, localhost:3000/place, it would be /place.
